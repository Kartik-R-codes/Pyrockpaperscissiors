This is how this works:

the user presses enter and calls a function that asks for user input.

the user input accepts r (for rock), p (for paper), and s (for scissiors)

the inputs r, p, and s get turned into numbers 0, 1, and 2 respectively

using the  random  python library, a randominteger ranging between 0 and 2 is made

0 stands for rock, 1 for paper and 2 for scissiors

the program uses a bunch of if-elif-else statements to figure out whether
 
the output should be win, tie or lose.

**you may take a look at the code to understand better.**


**This probably won't be updated anytime soon as... what else can i add to rock paper scissiors?**
